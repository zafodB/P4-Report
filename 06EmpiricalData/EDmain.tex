To prove that platooning is not just another technology being developed without a real added value, several projects and researches has been made to obtain the data to prove its benefits (some of them are mentioned in Literature review chapter - \hyperref[sec:SARTRE]{SARTRE}, \hyperref[sec:Companion]{Companion}). As we didnâ€™t have sufficient budget and time to do the whole development of the system and later on to carry out test to get the data, we looked into those projects to find out whether platooning will be beneficial for people. The areas we tried to cover are fuel consumption, drag, latency, and monetising.
