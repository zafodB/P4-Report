\section{Empirical data}\label{sec:data}
% 
In this section the knowledge we got from other projects, research papers, interviews and surveys is. First an interview we did with the test truck driver of platooning is presented. Followed by secondary data section where data about fuel saving, drag, latency and monetised benefits of platooning are shown. The last section is about truck drivers' opinion on platooning based on surveys.

\subsection{Interviews}
% 
Early in the process we have contacted several stakeholders like Car2car communication consortium, Scania, Vejdirektoratet (Danish road responsible) and Morten Lindbo, press officer of DTL (Danish Transport and Logistics association) by email. We only got the response from Morten Lindbo who gave us contact to their technical consultant and test driver - Finn Bjerremand with whom we manage to have a skype interview.

\subsection{Secondary data}
% 
To prove that platooning is not just another technology being developed without a real added value, several projects and researches has been made to obtain the data to prove its benefits (some of them are mentioned in Literature review chapter - \hyperref[sec:SARTRE]{SARTRE}, \hyperref[sec:Companion]{Companion}). As we didnâ€™t have sufficient budget and time to do the whole development of the system and later on to carry out test to get the data, we looked into those projects to find out whether platooning will be beneficial for people. The areas we tried to cover are fuel consumption, drag, latency, and monetising.
