\subsubsection{\textit{Industry Needs and Opportunities for Truck Platooning}}
% 
This section is named after a research report \cite{Shladover2015IndustryPlatooning} published in early 2015 that analysed, how truck drivers and fleet operators perceive emerging concept of platooning. The research was conducted in the US administering several surveys to several several target groups with comprehensive reach on around hundred individual people. These people were either truck drivers, fleet operators, or individual owner-operators\footnotemark. The main findings were, that truck drivers were not willing to delay their departure in order to facilitate platooning and also, they were mostly not willing to pay to the first truck (who had smaller savings). The drivers were also not very keen on adopting the platooning, however, it was later shown that better explanation about the system resulted in increased willingness to use it. Together with the fleet managers, who understood the possibility of fuel savings, especially in larger fleet, the researchers have concluded there is a group of stakeholders who may pose as 'early adopters' of the system, once it is ready to be deployed.
