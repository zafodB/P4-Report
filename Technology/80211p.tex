\subsubsection{802.11p}
% 
802.11p is amendment to standard 802.11 by IEEE. The amendment 802.11p was developed between 2005 and 2009 and was approved and published in 2010 as \enquote{Amendment 6: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments}. It was included in 2012 revision of 802.11 and onwards.
802.11p is designed for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. This communication can often exist for short period of time only, therefore some of the properties (such as authentication) defined by original 802.11 standards are omitted. The 802.11p has served as base for the ITS-G5 standard (described in next section).\par
