We can overall conclude that concept of platooning is heavily researched area. The articles regarding vehicles driving in strings range as back as the eighties \cite{Peppard1974StringSystems}.
Since then the research has been divided into two major areas, as described by \cite{Vinel2015Vehicle-to-vehicleScenarios}. First area is the \emph{Cooperative adaptive cruise control} and the second one is \emph{platooning}. While both touch the scope of our project and should be researched, we focused mainly on the latter. Some of the most recent and most significant projects, both supported by European Commission are SARTRE \cite{Chan2012ProjectSARTRE} and Safespot \cite{Safespot}. They review continues by discussing the inter-vehicular connectivity and Companion project afterwards.\par
