\subsection{V2V}

V2V communication is a vehicle-to-vehicle communication, where vehicles can communicate with each other and share vital information. In last decades, a lot of research (\cite{Chan2012ProjectSARTRE}, \cite{Safespot}, \cite{2016CompanionProject}) has been done in field of V2V, in which different companies, institutions or organisations participated (either as part of project or on their own). This led to creation and adaptation of standards so that developed technologies by different companies can communicate without difficulties. For the short-range communication IEEE 802.11p standard is adopted which is a wireless protocol (similar to Wi-Fi), operating on 5.85-5.925 GHz (depending on country).
