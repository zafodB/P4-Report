\subsection{V2I}
% 
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure technologies are still under development, but they have great potential. Its main idea is communication with vehicle by any road side unit (e.g. traffic lights, road sensors) to prevent accidents and improve road efficiency.\par

There are no standards yet of what \acrshort{V2I} system architecture should consist of. Architecture framework defined by USDOTs' ITS Joint Program Office \cite{Dr.Gaspar2014HighlySystems} states, that minimal parts for \acrshort{V2I} system are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Vehicle \acrlong{OBU}
    \item \acrlong{RSU}
    \item Safe Communication Channel.
\end{itemize}
% 
Communication is based on 802.11p standard by \acrshort{IEEE}, which will be discussed in detail in following chapters. A frequency spectrum in 5.9 GHz range was allocated for exact means in US and Europe \cite{2011TheTechnology}. Although, there are some concerns sharing allocated spectrum, since Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 allowed use of 5.9GHz spectrum for any unlicensed devices and that could cause harmful interference for sending and receiving data in \acrshort{V2I} communication \cite{U.S.GovernmentAccountabilityOffice2015IntelligentExist}.\par

Figure \ref{fig:V2Iimplementation} shows one of the possible uses of \acrshort{V2I} communication. Despite any concerns, Vehicle-to-Infrastructure is quickly developing and gaining a lot of attention from scientists and businesses worldwide. Figure \ref{fig:V2Idevelopment} presents, how \acrshort{V2I} is expected to evolve in the future.\par
