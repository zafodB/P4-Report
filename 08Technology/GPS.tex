\subsection{GPS}
One of the important information needed for platooning, is the ability to know the exact location of a car or any vehicle in the VANET system. By taking advantage of the Global Positioning System (GPS) it is possible to do so.\par

The GPS work by having at least 24 satellites orbiting the earth, ground stations and lastly a receiver. 4 visible satellites send out microwave signals to the receiver, which then uses triangulation to figure out where the receiver is on earth. Though only 3 satellites are needed for the triangulation, the 4th is a safety measure in case the calculation is wrong or if altitude and latitude is needed. The ground stations is to know where the satellites are in relative to the earth \cite{MiTACIntl.2011HowWork}.\par

Every microwave is sent on exact intervals, the data in the signal is the ID of the satellite, the location of all the satellites and time. With this information, the receiver can do the trilateration process and determine the location of the receiver.
