\section{Technology}\label{sec:technology}

Usually during platooning, vehicles moving high speeds need to be connected for a short period of time only. The vehicles that need to be interconnected, however, can change every moment. The connection need to be established locally and with as little set-up time, as possible, otherwise we risk two vehicles being out of range due to high mobility. In this chapter we explore local wireless networks, that are crucial for enabling any platooning scenario. First we see, what VANET is and what is its relation to Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication. Then we will investigate into the standards that are prevalent in establishing these connections, such as 802.11 or ARIB. We will cover the basics of the operation of these technologies, as well as their relative performance in platooning scenarios.\par

At the end, we will describe shortly about GPS, as this technology is a requirement in many cases of platooning implementation.

\subsection{Conclusion}

We can see that authorities are aware of the need for inter-vehicular communication. Developed standards and allocated frequency bands indicate the readiness for the platooning scenario. Although the standards are still very recent and it may take a while, before all the issues are resolved (e.g. quality of service issues during higher node penetration in WAVE \& ETSI ITS-G5), generally, there is technology capable of transmitting any data required for the platooning to be enabled. There are some differences among regions of world, for instance the ARIB vs. 802.11p standards, which use different protocols and different frequencies. These differences, however are mostly present on the PHY and MAC layer, thus a uniform solution can be developed on the higher layers, if 802.11p, ITS-G5 or ARIB is used. WAVE architecture even contains standards and guidelines for the communication at network and transport layer, thus allowing for even easier adoption of platooning.
