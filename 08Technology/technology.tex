\section{Technology}\label{sec:technology}

Usually during platooning, the vehicles moving high speeds need to be connected for a short period of time only. The vehicles that need to be interconnected, however, can change every moment. The connections need to be established locally and with as little set-up time, as possible, otherwise we risk two vehicles being out of range due to high mobility. In this chapter we explore local wireless networks, that are crucial for enabling any platooning scenario. First we see, what VANET is and what is its relation to Vehicle-to-vehicle and Vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Then we will investigate into the standards that are prevalent in establishing these connections, such as 802.11 or ARIB. We will cover the basics of the operation of these technologies, as well as their relative performance in platooning scenarios.\par

At the end, we will describe shortly about GPS, as this technology is a requirement in many cases of platooning implementation.

\subsection{Conclusion}

We can see that authorities are aware of the need for inter-vehicular communication. Developed standards and allocated frequency bands indicate the readiness for the platooning scenario. Although the standards are still very recent and it may take a while, before all the issues are resolved, generally, there is technology capable of transmitting any data required for enabling of platooning. There are some differences among regions of world, for instance the ARIB vs. 802.11p standards, which use different protocols and different frequencies. These differences, however are mostly present on the PHY and MAC layer, thus a uniform solution can be developed on the higher layers.
